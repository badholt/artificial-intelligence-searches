 ^-- Main.Java
     The main program scans data and feeds it into searches.

 ^-- DataReader.Java
     This is the main program's description.  It takes these
     arguments, has an interface maybe, and uses a
     particular problem instance (with this appx. runtime).

 ^-- BreadthFirstSearch.Java
     This is the main program's description.  It takes these
     arguments, has an interface maybe, and uses a
     particular problem instance (with this appx. runtime).

 ^-- DepthFirstSearch.Java
     This is the main program's description.  It takes these
     arguments, has an interface maybe, and uses a
     particular problem instance (with this appx. runtime).

 This project seemed enormous to me, albeit I had extenuated circumstances. In
 hindsight I spent way too much time trying to optimize my design, instead of
 creating something that worked first and optimizing for there. I spent several
 hours on unnecessary GUI setup, which I ended up not using. Overall, I must
 have spent at least 20 hours on the assignment, which I'm afraid ended up
 incomplete. I tried this assignment using a new IDE, which complicated matters
 further. Somewhere between my repository commits I lost code on two occasions.
 The current code is what was salvaged after some work seems to have
 disappeared "overnight."
